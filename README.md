After create the project, and opened, the WebStorm will report an issue:

```
Load error: undefined path variables
KOTLIN_BUNDLED is undefined. Fix it
Path variables are used to substitute absolute paths in WebStorm project files and allow project file sharing in version control systems.
Some of the files describing the current project settings contain unknown path variables and WebStorm cannot restore those paths.
```
To fix it, just click the **Fix it** link, enter the value as follows:
```
Windows:
C:\Program Files\Android Studio\plugins\Kotlin\kotlinc
Mac:
/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/plugins/Kotlin/kotlinc
```
